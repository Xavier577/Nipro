# Overview

This is a Django(React) application called Nipro. It's purpose is to connect developers
locally in my region(Nigeria). For more info on the project check the Application.md file in the documentation
directory

# Get started

Download the project with git clone github.com/Xavier577/Nipro.git

# Installs

If you have pipenv installed, Run 

pipenv install (to install packages in pipfile)

Run: python manage.py runserver to run the server in the base directory(the directory that contains all the entire project).

Then go to (cd into) the frontend directory and Run,

npm install (to install the dependencies in the package.json file).

Then,

npm run dev (to render the react templates)

Then you should have the web-app all well and running :) .

And if you don't have pipenv installed you can just install all the packages in the Pipfile
or if you have them installed (by chance)  it should work just fine. :)
