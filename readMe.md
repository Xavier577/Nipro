# Overview

This is a Django(React) application called Nipro. It's purpose is to connect developers
locally in my region(Nigeria). For more info on the project check the Application.md file in the documentation
directory

# Get started

Download the project with git clone github.com/Xavier577/Nipro.git

# Installs

If you have pipenv installed, in the root directory
>Run 
```
pipenv install (to install packages in pipfile)
```
>Run
```
python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate 

python manage.py runserver (this runs the server)
```
>Then 
```
cd frontend 

npm install (to install the dependencies in the package.json file).

npm run dev (to render the react templates)
```

Then you should have the web-app all well and running :) .

And if you don't have pipenv installed you can just install all the packages in the Pipfile
or if you have them installed (by chance) it should work just fine. :)
